        Badminton is a fun active sport which is an easy game to practice with few painless rules. It's an indoor sport, so we can play it any time of the year, any time of day. It's a great social event where we can have fun with friends who are beginners and also friends that really know how to play. It is a sport that explores speed changes, reaction time demands, muscular strength and endurance challenges, and is heart-pumping fun. Badminton can reduce or eliminate our risk for many health problems. For badminton, all we need is a racket, a shuttlecock, and a court to play on. In India, badminton is the fastest growing sport, second only to cricket.
